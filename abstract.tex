    The current work presents a comprehensive study on the spectral characteristics and parameters of the supersoft X-ray source \source. We utilize a dataset comprising six observations conducted by four different satellite missions spanning a time period of 25 years. Our objective is to identify a robust NLTE spectral model that can provide an acceptable fit to the continuum spectrum of \source, thereby enhancing our understanding of its astrophysical nature. The study employs rigorous spectral modeling and comparative analysis to establish a framework for characterizing the continuum spectrum of \source. The document also discusses the analysis of the supersoft spectrum of \source, including the challenges in reproducing its spectra using NLTE model atmospheres. The best-fit model consists of a pure hydrogen NLTE model with effective gravity of 7, multiplied with photoelectric absorption, ISM absorption and edge components. The effective temperature is found to be approximately of the order of $\sim$100 kK for all six observations, suggesting the presence of a hot accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, which accretes matter from a companion main-sequence star. The study also analyzes the relative strengths of absorption edges in the spectrum and notes inconsistencies in the NICER observations. It makes a case for the need to explore and develop methods that study the latest high-resolution grating spectra, so as to obtain a more nuanced view of the astrophysics involving \source.
