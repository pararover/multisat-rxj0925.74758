	The best-fit model consists of XSPEC model components which consider various factors affecting the observed spectrum:
    \begin{enumerate}[a)]
   		\item \texttt{atable\{}pure-H NLTE with $\log{g}=7$\texttt{\}}: for the actual radiation emitted by \source
   		\item \texttt{edge}: for specific wavelengths where bound-free absorption is particularly strong, leading to absorption edges
   		\item \texttt{phabs}: for describing the photoelectric absorption at the source itself.
   		\item \texttt{ismabs}: for describing how light interacts with the intervening inter-stellar medium before reaching us
   	\end{enumerate}
