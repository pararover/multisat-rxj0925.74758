\section{Observations}
	During the course of our investigation of the continuum spectrum of \source, we leveraged a comprehensive dataset comprising six observations conducted by four distinct satellite missions spanning the years 1994 to 2019. We extracted spectral data within the range 0.2 -- 1.0 keV from each observation in this dataset. This afforded us the opportunity to apply a consistent spectral analysis approach across a broad temporal range and disparate instrumentation platforms. Our primary objective was to identify a robust spectral model capable of providing an acceptable fit to the continuum spectrum of \source.
	
	Another motivation for harnessing multi-satellite observations over an extended period was to mitigate potential biases associated with individual instruments and temporal variations in observational conditions, thereby enabling a systematic examination of the source's spectral characteristics, in an attempt to constrain the underlying physical processes driving the observed supersoft X-ray emission.
	
	%The amalgamation of observations from diverse satellite missions offered unique insights into the spectral evolution of the supersoft X-ray source over time, shedding light on its dynamic behavior and emission properties. Through rigorous spectral modeling and comparative analysis, we endeavored to establish a robust framework for characterizing the continuum spectrum of the supersoft source, thereby enhancing our understanding of its astrophysical nature and evolutionary trends.

	A summary of the observations used in this study, which included observational data from ASCA \cite{ebisawaAsca2001ApJ}, Chandra \cite{beardaChandra2002AA}, XMM-Newton \cite{motchXmmNewton2002AA} and NICER \cite{orioNicer2022ApJ}, is presented in table \ref{tab:obs-journal}. %Journal of observations goes in here, which will contain the observation details of the data used from ASCA, Chandra ACIS, XMM-Newton EPIC-pn and possibly NICER.
