\section{Observations}
	During our investigation of the continuum spectrum of \source, we utilized six observations made by four different space observatories between 1994 and 2019.
	%During the course of our investigation of the continuum spectrum of \source, we leveraged a comprehensive dataset comprising six observations conducted by four distinct space observatories spanning the years 1994 to 2019.
	By extracting spectral data within the range 0.2 -- 1.0 keV from each observation, we were able to apply a consistent spectral analysis approach across a broad temporal range and disparate instrumentation platforms.
		
	In addition to the science data using observations from NASA's Chandra and ESA's XMM-Newton, studied earlier by Bearda \textit{et al.} (2002) and Motch \textit{et al.} (2002) respectively, we have included observations studied using Japan's ASCA \cite{ebisawaAsca2001ApJ} and ISS' NICER \cite{orioNicer2022ApJ}, studied respectively by Ebisawa \textit{et al.} (2001) and Orio \textit{et al.} (2022). A summary of these observations used in this study, %which included science data from Japan's ASCA \cite{ebisawaAsca2001ApJ}, NASA's Chandra \cite{beardaChandra2002AA}, ESA's XMM-Newton \cite{motchXmmNewton2002AA} and ISS' NICER \cite{orioNicer2022ApJ} observatories,
	is presented in table \ref{tab:obs-journal}. %Journal of observations goes in here, which will contain the observation details of the data used from ASCA, Chandra ACIS, XMM-Newton EPIC-pn and possibly NICER.
