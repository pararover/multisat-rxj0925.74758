\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To include a detailed description of the physics behind the best fit model
        \item To refer to the original publications containing the XSPEC model components where the physics is described

    An inspection of the distribution of the residual suggests an approximately normal distribution, as can be observed in , further supporting the validity of the model fit with a reduced chi-squared of 1.45 and satisfactory results from the [name of goodness-of-fit test(s)].
